  "description": "Pickled cucumbers represent a significant Soviet practice for food storage that spread to Central Asia in the 1960s. Pickling was a widely-used way of storing food in the USSR, playing an important role in mitigating shortages.",
  "commentary": "A three-liter jar of pickled cucumbers inspired by the author's grandmother Dilar's 1960s recipe. Pickling represented a new practice brought by socialism, replacing traditional drying and curing methods. Families engaged in competitive canning, with some preserving hundreds of jars annually. The practice created social rituals and home-based production teams. Pickled foods transcended national cuisine boundaries and helped families survive Soviet shortages.",
