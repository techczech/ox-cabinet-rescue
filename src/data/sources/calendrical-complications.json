  "description": "Medieval societies faced the challenge of reconciling astronomical and ecclesiastical timekeeping systems. The fundamental problem: 'There are not a whole number of lunar months in a solar year.' Determining the date of church holy days often involved combining solar, lunar, and ecclesiastical cycles. Easter's calculation exemplifies this complexity: 'the first Sunday after the first full moon following the spring equinox.'",
